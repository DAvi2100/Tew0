<h3>
	<div style="text-align: center;">
		I hear it from my friends
I hear it on the street
I hear it in the air, here and there, everywhere
And from everyone I meet
And every time I hear you love me
Ooh, my heart skips
But I want to hear it from your lips
(You never told me, ooh, you never told me)
I want to hear it from your lips
(You never told me, ooh)
I hear it in my car
I hear it on the phone
I hear it in a crowd, nice and loud, completely now
I hear it when I'm all alone
And every time I hear you love me
Ooh, my heart skips <br>
But I want to hear it from your lips
(You never told me, ooh, you never told me)
I want to hear it from your lips
</div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
(You never told me, ooh)
Everybody's been told, and the whole world knows
Just how good our love is gonna be
But ooh-ee (ooh-ee), Baby (baby)
You never told me <br>
You never told me
I see it in your eyes
I feel it in your touch
You even found a way you can say all you mean
But you never say too much
And if you'd only say you love me
Ooh, my heart'll flip

And I want to hear it from your lips
(You never told me, ooh, you never told me)
I got to hear it from your lips
(You never told me, ooh you never told me)
Baby, baby, I got to have it from your lips
(You never told me, ooh, you never told me)
I want to hear it from your lips
(You never told me, ooh, you never told me)
I want to hear it from your lips
(You never told me, ooh, you never told me)
I want to hear it from your lips
